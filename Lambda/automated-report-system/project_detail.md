# Automated Report System using AWS Lambda  

## Project Overview  
This project is an **Automated Report Generation and Delivery System** implemented using **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon S3**, and **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**. It automatically generates a daily PDF report, uploads it to **Amazon S3**, and sends it as an email attachment using **SES**. The entire process is serverless, ensuring cost efficiency and scalability.  

## Key Features  
- **Automated PDF Generation**: Uses the `FPDF` Python library to generate a **daily report**.  
- **Storage on Amazon S3** *(Optional)*: The generated PDF is uploaded to **Amazon S3** for backup and accessibility.  
- **Email Delivery via Amazon SES**: The system sends an **email with the report as an attachment** using **AWS Simple Email Service (SES)**.  
- **Serverless Deployment**: The function runs on **AWS Lambda**, eliminating the need for managing servers.  
- **Secure and Scalable**: Uses AWS services to ensure reliability, security, and scalability.  

## Workflow  
1. **Trigger**: AWS Lambda function is triggered (either manually, on schedule via AWS EventBridge, or based on an event).  
2. **PDF Report Generation**: The function creates a PDF report with predefined content.  
3. **Upload to Amazon S3** *(Optional)*: The generated PDF is stored in an **S3 bucket** for archival purposes.  
4. **Email via SES**: The function sends the PDF as an **email attachment** to a recipient using **Amazon SES**.  
5. **Completion & Logging**: The function logs the success or failure of the operation.  

## AWS Services Used  
- **AWS Lambda**: Runs the Python script to generate and email reports.  
- **Amazon S3** *(Optional)*: Stores the generated PDF for future access.  
- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: Sends the report as an email attachment.  

## Use Cases  
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Reports**: Automate report generation and delivery for businesses.  
- **Financial Summaries**: Send automated financial reports to stakeholders.  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Generate and distribute system or employee performance reports.  
- **Automated Notifications**: Send updates and reports based on predefined schedules.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Customizable Reports**: Allow users to customize report content dynamically.  
- **Integration with Databases**: Fetch real-time data from **DynamoDB** or **RDS** for more detailed reports.  
- **Multi-Recipient Emails**: Enable sending reports to multiple recipients dynamically.  
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Integrate with **AWS EventBridge** to schedule reports based on business needs.
